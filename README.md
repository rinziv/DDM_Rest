```
**RuntimeError**: Python is not installed as a framework. The Mac OS X backend will not be able to function...

In order to fix it, follow these steps ([complete solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21784641/installation-issue-with-matplotlib-python))
 - I assume you have installed the pip matplotlib, there is a directory in you root called ~/.matplotlib.
